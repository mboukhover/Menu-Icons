**Menu-Icons**
===============

This is a menu icons system made using SVG to alert people visually on characteristics of their foods.

This icon system was originally created by Sabrina or saba11214. You can check out the original
icon system on her [website](http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~sa3806/drawing/Assignment2/) or
her original [repository](https://github.com/saba11214/Menu-Icons).

Current icons included nuts for nuts, lobster to show any shellfish products, wheat to show any gluten products, a pepper to designate spicy dishes, and a candy to designate high sugar content.  
I have added a martini glass for alcoholic beverages.
