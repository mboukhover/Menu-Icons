**Menu-Icons**
===============

Menu icons made using SVG
--------------------------

####I made this menu icon system so it will be easier for people to know what type of allergic foods are their meals.####

####Currently, I have the :candy: to show any sweets, the :chestnut: to show any nuts, the :shell: to show any marine animals, the :herb: to show any wheat products, and the :closed_umbrella: to show if the dish is spicy. You can check them out on my [website](http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~sa3806/drawing/Assignment2/).####
